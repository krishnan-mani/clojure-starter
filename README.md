# clojure-starter
Clone and use this to write some Clojure code, the TDD way! You can now open this project in a VS Code workspace on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) and start coding right away.

## Usage

```shell
# run all tests. You should see one failing test that you can fix and re-run tests to go green.
$ lein kaocha unit

# run tests automatically on change
$ lein auto kaocha unit

# launch a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL)
$ lein repl
```
